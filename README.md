Files included in client/
 - index.html - Main page with HTML markup
 - index.js - Contains JS / Vue.js objects and properties
 - styles.less - Contains page styles written in LESS
 - style.css - CSS file that is compiled into by styles.less
 
File has two bugs:
 - Issue with input binding after pressing a button. It's recommended to just write over old input.
 - Drop Down menu in "Review Your Survey" section should be optimized
 
 Recommendatations:
 - Open with Google Chrome with Page Size at 100%
 
ENJOY!
